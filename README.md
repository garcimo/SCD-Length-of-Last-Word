# SCD-Length-of-Last-Word
C++ program created for Society of Computer Developer's Winter 2022 Hackathon. 

"Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, 
return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring 
consisting of non-space characters only." 

3 inputs were given to test:

  1. Input: s = "Hello World"
     Output: 5
     
  2. Input: s = "   fly me   to  the moon  "
     Output: 4
  
  3. Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
     Output: 6
